<small>Serverless computing allows developers to retrieve computing power on-demand without holding idle infrastructure. One of the most popular services of this model is **AWS Lambda**.</small>

<small>This series provides a practical introduction to the AWS service ecosystem and AWS Lambda, by using Lambda to automatically transcribe videodata uploaded to an **S3 bucket** using **AWS Transcribe**. We will make use of the **AWS SDK** to programatically interact with the different services and finally use **Terraform** to deploy and manage all used resources.</small>

<small>While the transcription serves as a common use case, the learnings hopefully extend to a broad range of similar challenges.</small>
