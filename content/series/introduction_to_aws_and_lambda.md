name: Introduction to AWS & Lambda
description: Serverless computing allows developers to retrieve computing power on-demand without holding idle infrastructure. One of the most popular services of this model is AWS Lambda. This series provides a practical introduction to the AWS service ecosystem and AWS Lambda, by using Lambda to automatically transcribe videodata uploaded to an S3 bucket using AWS Transcribe. We will make use of the AWS SDK to programatically interact with the different services and finally use Terraform to deploy and manage all used resources.
