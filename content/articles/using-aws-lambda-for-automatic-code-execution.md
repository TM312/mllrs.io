## Introduction
Serverless computing allows developers to retrieve computing power on-demand without holding idle infrastructure. One of the most popular services of this model is <a href='https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/'>AWS Lambda</a>.

This post provides a practical introduction to AWS Lambda in which we will use the service to automatically transcribe videodata uploaded to an <a href='https://aws.amazon.com/s3/'>S3 bucket</a> using <a href='https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/'>AWS Transcribe</a>. We will make use of the AWS SDK <a href='https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html'>boto3</a> to programatically interact with the different services and use <a href='https://www.terraform.io/'>Terraform</a> to deploy and manage all resources.

In the following we will briefly discuss each of the aforementioned services.
