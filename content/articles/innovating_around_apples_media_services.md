From my perspective, there exists today three key trends shaping the dynamics of digital media:

## On Demand

Consumers move from ownership to access. Leading market players offer four key value propositions:
1. perception of free access,
2. vast genre-crossing catalogues,
3. anytime access, and
4. reduced search costs through personalised recommendations

__Key Monetization__ Subscription (Netflix, Disney+), Ads (Youtube), Cross-selling (Prime Video)

__Apples Role__ Apple services (Apple Music, AppleTV+) are in competition with highly funded players. Content production costs and content specialisation prevent dominance of a single player. However, Apple has unique leverage of its hardware-software ecosystem to drive adoption (AppleTV+ with device purchase).


## Live

Consumers move towards live consumption formats such as 24/7 talkshows on Clubhouse, game streams on Twitch, sales on Taobao Live.
Unlike traditional media, livestreams are typically:
1. unpolished,
2. dynamic, and
3. allow producer-consumer interaction.

__Key Monetization__ Subscription (Twitch), Ads (Twitch, Youtube Live), E-commerce (Kuaishou, Tabao Live)

__Apples Role__ With exception of its annual Apple Event & WWDC, Apple is not yet engaged in ‘live’ experiences.


## Democratized

Production is increasingly democratised, from TikTok videos, to Facebook Live auctions, and to Gumroad everything. Democratised production has become professionalized, and an extensive ecosystem of tools is emerging to cater to creators, such as with DJI camera tools.

__Key Monetization__ Transaction fees (Gumroad), End consumer fees (Spotify), Ads (Instagram)

__Apples Role__ The App Store is a democratisation platform that enables developers from any-sized teams to create, distribute and profit. Apple’s innovation on image quality (both in camera hardware and ML research) also facilitates the democratised production of visual content.

<br>

Today, Apple benefits from first-order revenue through direct sales of devices and content. Apple also benefits from higher-order network effects and revenue from developers distributing via App Store, and content creators monetising within apps.
<br>
For successful innovation, Apple can further leverage these higher-order effects by increasing support for content creators focusing on the above 3 trends. For instance, COVID bears great innovation potentials for app developers and artists as the pandemic has accelerated the scale and scope of mobile media consumption, while draining many traditional revenue channels such as music concerts. Hence, a possible avenue of innovation for Apple could be Clubhouse-for-music, where iTunes hosts live remote music festivals allowing for 24/7 listening and direct interactions with artists, similar to what Twitch allows with gamers.
